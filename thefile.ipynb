    "For example, the 2024 survey gathered responses from over 65,000 developers across 185 countries between May 19 and June 20, 2024. The survey data is publicly available under the Open Database License (ODbL).\n",

    "The Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 is highly relevant to our research because it provides comprehensive insights into the skills, career motivations, frustrations, and job satisfaction of software developers worldwide. Our research focuses on improving hiring and retention strategies in the tech industry by identifying real-world indicators of developer success beyond traditional credentials. The survey’s data validates our central argument: technical ability alone does not define a strong developer—continuous learning, problem-solving, and workplace satisfaction are equally critical factors. The findings show that 82% of developers rely on self-directed learning, underscoring the importance of adaptability over static qualifications. Furthermore, the survey highlights key retention challenges, such as technical debt (the number-one frustration) and burnout from excessive workloads, reinforcing the idea that hiring the right developers must go beyond simple coding assessments. By leveraging this dataset, we can analyze trends that impact developer hiring and retention, providing data-driven strategies to help companies predict job success, reduce turnover, and build more resilient teams."
